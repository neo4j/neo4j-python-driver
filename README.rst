****************************
Neo4j Bolt Driver for Python
****************************

This repository contains the official Neo4j driver for Python.

Starting with 5.0, the Neo4j Drivers will be moving to a monthly release
cadence. A minor version will be released on the last Friday of each month so
as to maintain versioning consistency with the core product (Neo4j DBMS) which
has also moved to a monthly cadence.

As a policy, patch versions will not be released except on rare occasions. Bug
fixes and updates will go into the latest minor version and users should
upgrade to that. Driver upgrades within a major version will never contain
breaking API changes.

+ Python 3.10 supported.
+ Python 3.9 supported.
+ Python 3.8 supported.
+ Python 3.7 supported.


Installation
============

To install the latest stable version, use:

.. code:: bash

    pip install neo4j


Quick Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    from neo4j import GraphDatabase

    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687",
                                  auth=("neo4j", "password"))

    def add_friend(tx, name, friend_name):
        tx.run("MERGE (a:Person {name: $name}) "
               "MERGE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(friend:Person {name: $friend_name})",
               name=name, friend_name=friend_name)

    def print_friends(tx, name):
        query = ("MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(friend) WHERE a.name = $name "
                 "RETURN friend.name ORDER BY friend.name")
        for record in tx.run(query, name=name):
            print(record["friend.name"])

    with driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:
        session.execute_write(add_friend, "Arthur", "Guinevere")
        session.execute_write(add_friend, "Arthur", "Lancelot")
        session.execute_write(add_friend, "Arthur", "Merlin")
        session.execute_read(print_friends, "Arthur")

    driver.close()


Connection Settings Breaking Change (4.x)
=========================================

+ The driverâ€™s default configuration for encrypted is now false
  (meaning that driver will only attempt plain text connections by default).

+ Connections to encrypted services (such as Neo4j Aura) should now explicitly
  be set to encrypted.

+ When encryption is explicitly enabled, the default trust mode is to trust the
  CAs that are trusted by operating system and use hostname verification.

+ This means that encrypted connections to servers holding self-signed
  certificates will now fail on certificate verification by default.

+ Using the new ``neo4j+ssc`` scheme will allow to connect to servers holding self-signed certificates and not use hostname verification.

+ The ``neo4j://`` scheme replaces ``bolt+routing://`` and can be used for both clustered and single-instance configurations with Neo4j 4.0.

See, https://neo4j.com/docs/driver-manual/current/client-applications/#driver-connection-uris for changes in default security settings between 3.x and 4.x


Connecting with Python Driver 4.x to Neo4j 3.5 (EOL)
----------------------------------------------------

Using the Python Driver 4.x and connecting to Neo4j 3.5 with default connection settings for Neo4j 3.5.

.. code-block:: python

    # the preferred form

    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j+ssc://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

    # is equivalent to

    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"), encrypted=True, trust=False)


Connecting with Python Driver 1.7 (EOL) to Neo4j 4.x
----------------------------------------------------

Using the Python Driver 1.7 and connecting to Neo4j 4.x with default connection settings for Neo4j 4.x.

.. code-block:: python

    driver = GraphDatabase.driver("neo4j://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"), encrypted=False)
