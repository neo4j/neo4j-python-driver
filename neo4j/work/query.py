        a dictionary with metadata.
        Specified metadata will be attached to the executing transaction and visible in the output of ``dbms.listQueries`` and ``dbms.listTransactions`` procedures.
        It will also get logged to the ``query.log``.
        This functionality makes it easier to tag transactions and is equivalent to ``dbms.setTXMetaData`` procedure, see https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/procedures/ for procedure reference.
    :type metadata: dict

    :param timeout:
        the transaction timeout in seconds.
        Transactions that execute longer than the configured timeout will be terminated by the database.
        This functionality allows to limit query/transaction execution time.
        Specified timeout overrides the default timeout configured in the database using ``dbms.transaction.timeout`` setting.
        Value should not represent a negative duration.
        A zero duration will make the transaction execute indefinitely.
        None will use the default timeout configured in the database.
