:mod:`.neo4j.aio` -- Asynchronous Bolt protocol I/O
===================================================

The :mod:`.neo4j.aio` module contains classes for working with the Bolt
protocol via Python's asynchronous I/O capabilities.

Three classes are provided:

- :class:`.Bolt` - single connection to a server
- :class:`.BoltPool` - pool of connections to a server
- :class:`.Neo4jPool` - pool of connections to a cluster of servers
