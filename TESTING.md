# Neo4j Driver Testing

To run driver tests, [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) is required as well as at least one version of Python.
The versions of Python supported by this driver are CPython 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.


## Unit Tests & Stub Tests

Unit tests and stub tests (those which make use of the [boltkit](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/boltkit) stub server) can be run using:
```bash
$ tox
```

## Integration Tests

Each test run can also carry out integration tests against a specific version of Neo4j.
To enable integration tests, a server must be made available.
This can be either an existing server listening on the default Bolt port (7687) or a temporary installation from a particular package.
For example:
```bash
$ NEO4J_SERVER_PACKAGE=~/dist/neo4j-enterprise-3.1.1-unix.tar.gz tox
```

A web address can be provided as an alternative to a file path:
```bash
$ NEO4J_SERVER_PACKAGE=https://dist.neo4j.org/neo4j-enterprise-3.1.1-unix.tar.gz tox
```

If using an existing server, authentication details can be provided in a similar way:
```bash
$ NEO4J_USER=bob NEO4J_PASSWORD=secret tox
```


## Code Coverage

If [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) is installed, test runs automatically add data to a `.coverage` file.
To use this data, ensure that `coverage erase` is executed before commencing a test run;
a report can be viewed after the run with `coverage report --show-missing`.

## Testing with Testkit

Tests **require** the latest [Testkit 4.4](https://github.com/neo4j-drivers/testkit/tree/4.4), Python3 and Docker.

Testkit is needed to be cloned and configured to run against the Python Driver. Use the following steps to configure Testkit.

1. Clone the Testkit repositoryâ€”preferably not inside this project's folder

```
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-drivers/testkit.git
```

2. Under the Testkit folder, install the requirements.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Define some enviroment variables to configure Testkit

```
export TEST_DRIVER_NAME=python
export TEST_DRIVER_REPO=<path for the root folder of driver repository>
```

To run test against against some Neo4j version:

```
python3 main.py
```

More details about how to use Teskit could be found on [its repository](https://github.com/neo4j-drivers/testkit/tree/4.4)
